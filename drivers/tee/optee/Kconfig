	  This implements the OP-TEE Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
	  driver. OP-TEE is a Trusted OS designed primarily to rely on the
	  ARM TrustZone(R) technology as the underlying hardware isolation
	  mechanism. This driver can request services from OP-TEE, but also
	  handle Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) from OP-TEE needed to
	  execute a service. For more information see: https://www.op-tee.org
